# osPortfolio

This is my portfolio website designed to look like Windows 7 OS. I am constantly working to improve this project to closely resemble to aesthetics of Win 7.

## Currently
   - designing a start menu to pop up on click with the proper design requirements in mind
   - implementing a mail feature for you to send me emails from the website itself
